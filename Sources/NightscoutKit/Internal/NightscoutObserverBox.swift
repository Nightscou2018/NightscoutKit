/// Since `NightscoutObserver` used as a type is not directly convertible to `AnyObject`,
/// we use this "hack" to store observers weakly in order to avoid retain cycles.
/// This functionality could be generalized to some extent,
/// but this is basically a workaround for a `WeakBox<T: AnyObject>`
/// (which would not work in this situation for the reason described above).
